## How to file issues and get help

### GitHub issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mrrhak/s3_file_provider/issues/new/choose) to track bugs, questions, and feature requests.
GitHub issues are free, but **response time is not guaranteed**.

To ensure the relevance and manageability of our issue queue, we have designed it to help us respond to and resolve current issues more efficiently. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a focused and up-to-date issue-tracking system.
